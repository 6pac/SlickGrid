### This is the 6pac SlickGrid repo

Check out the NEW SlickGrid Website! http://slickgrid.net/

This is the acknowledged most active non-customised fork of SlickGrid.

It aims to be a viable alternative master repo, building on the legacy of the mleibman/SlickGrid master branch, keeping libraries up to date and applying small, safe core patches and enhancements without turning into a personalised build.

Check out the [examples](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/wiki/Examples) for examples demonstrating new features and use cases, such as dynamic grid creation and editors with third party controls.

Also check out the [wiki](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/wiki) for news and documentation.
